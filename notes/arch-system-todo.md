* scripted system for organizing to-do: I can press some hotkey to open up a text field then add a task, which will be stored as a bullet point in this file. I can press another hotkey to look at the whole list of tasks, and cross off tasks. Ideally, we would store these crossed-off tasks in a file. We can make a gui version with dmenu too. For now, finished tasks will be marked at the beginning.
* DONE example of finished task (for now)
* DONE configure home directory for user eliot with vimrc
* DONE give eliot sudo access, remove root
* DONE set up git repos for config files, notes
* DONE install DWM
* DONE find a good minimal package to set the background in DWM
* create a system for reminders (low battery, update system)
* create a widget that can show brightness/volume
* configure tmux-tilish plugin: needs to have the same keybinds as DWM, and start with the same master/stack layout
* learn vim: learn to integrate i/o from commands like xsel, etc
* configure autocomplete/ide utilities for editing code in vim; need code completion for libraries in C/C++, and python, but maybe also lua, js, java
* integrate gpg (or some other secure encryption) with vim to password protect passes.txt
* create script for uploading/downloading dotfiles between devices using git repo (some files will differ between devices)
* create install script/tutorial for setting up everything
